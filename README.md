### About the Project

We create a Text-to-Image Recommendation system that takes the text and headline of an article and recommends a set of best matching photos from APâ€™s archive.

### Deliverables

View our [Poster](https://github.com/phoebewong/AC297r_2019_Associated_Press/blob/master/submissions/final-presentation/ap_capstone_final_poster.pdf) and our [Final Presentation](https://github.com/phoebewong/AC297r_2019_Associated_Press/blob/master/submissions/final-presentation/ap_capstone_final_presentation.pdf) in the `submissions` folder. In addition, we also wrote a blog on Towards Data Science that you can read [here](todo).

### How to Install and Run the Project

#### If you don't have Python 3.6.9

1. `brew install pyenv`
2. `pyenv install 3.6.9`
3. `pyenv local 3.6.9`
4. `PATH="~/.pyenv/versions/3.6.9/bin:${PATH}"`

#### Create a virtual environment (Python 3.6.9)

1. `python3 -m venv capstone-test`
2. `source capstone-test/bin/activate`
3. `python --version` should be 3.6.9
4. `pip install --upgrade pip` optionally
5. `pip list` lists the following:

```
pip version 19.3.1
setuptools version 40.6.2
```

#### Clone our Github repository

1. `git clone https://github.com/phoebewong/AC297r_2019_Associated_Press.git`
2. `cd AC297r_2019_Associated_Press/`

#### Installing libraries

1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. `pip list` will now list all our requirements
3. `python -m spacy download en` to install the spacy model

#### Sensitive files

There are two sensitive files: one is our API key for the taxonomy data and the second is the API key for getting data from our on-demand queue given to us by the AP. These are the instructions for the the first file

1. Place the `tagging_api_password.ini` file in `src`
2. Rename the above file `password.ini`
3. Copy the above file to `src/taxonomy_data` and keep the name of the file the same (both files should be called `password.ini`

These are the instructions for the second set of files

1. Place the `on_demand_password.ini` file in `src/data_extraction` and rename the file `password.ini`

If you are using your own files, make sure you call them `password.ini` and place them in the appropriate directories. The format of the file is as follows:

```
[key]
apikey = yourApiKeyHere
```
#### Getting the data

1. Download the data (about 15gb) from google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12vmDT-GueP2-DooyaeQwEFrFz9K7SS_7/view?usp=sharing)
2. Unzip the data within the `src` folder. There should be a `src/data` folder now
3. If there is a folder called `__MACOSX` now created in the root directory of the github repository alongside the `data` directory, this folder can be deleted using `rm -rf __MACOSX`.
4. Copy the folder `src/data/preview` and `src/data/thumbnail` into `src/ui/static/img`
5. A sanity check: `ls src/ui/static/img` should show the folders `thumbnail`, `preview` and `spinner.gif`

#### Running the app

Run `make api` and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to test it out

#### Testing

Run `pytest test_project.py` from the project root.
